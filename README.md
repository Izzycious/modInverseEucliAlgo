# modInverseEucliAlgo

The Aim is to understand how cryptography works and to do so, the basic understanding of **Modular Arithemetic** is needed. Upon understanding this will we be able to write a distinct programme that calculates the **modular multiplicative inverse** of a number using the Euclidean Algorithm.

## This is a workthrough to calculate the modular multiplicative inverse of a number using Euclidean Algorithm

**First going through the Modular Maths:**

When the division of two integers an equation that looks like the following:

```
    A/B = Q reminder R

```

where :
_ A is the dividend
_ B is the divisor
_ Q is the quotient
_ R is the reminder
