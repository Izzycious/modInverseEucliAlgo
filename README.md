# modInverseEucliAlgo

The Aim is to understand how cryptography works and to do so, the basic understanding of **Module Arithemetic** is calculated. Upon understanding this will we be able to write a distinct programme that calculate the **modular multiplicative inverse** of a number using the Euclidean Algorithm.

## This is a workthrough to calculate the modular multiplicative inverse of a number using Euclidean Algorithm
